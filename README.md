Solved a business problem using SQL(Postgre):

Show results for customers that have placed at
least 5 orders, containing the following information:
- User ID
- Time (in days) since the user signed up to the app
- Total number of orders placed by the user
- Average order value
- Name of their favorite store, understanding this as the store with more orders (if there is a tie
use the one with the most recent order)
- % of delivered orders
- Time when the last order was placed
- Time (in days) that passed from the second last order to the last one
